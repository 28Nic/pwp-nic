    <h2 class="text-2xl">Content Strategy</h2>
    <h3 class="text-xl">Welcome Banner</h3>
    <p>I'll use this space to introduce myself with my name and an image of my knits or an illustration relating to them.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl">About Me</h3>
    <p>This section will have more information about myself and my love of fiber arts and beyond. I'll use this section to highlight my other interests and skill sets. I will feature an image of myself here. The tone will be casual and enthusiastic.</p>
    <h3 class="text-xl">Lessons</h3>
    <p> Here I'll highlight my lessons for and from knitting in a post-it note style. I'd love to add the ability for the user to "refresh" this section and pull new content to the notes.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl">Projects</h3>
    <p>This responsive gallery will feature images of some of my favorite projects with a hover feature that shows information on each one.  </p>
    <h3 class="text-xl">Connect</h3>
    <p>Finally, I'll have a simple contact me form with text that welcomes connections for fiber arts and beyond. Beneath it will be a footer with links to my other social profiles and a note about the website being made by me.</p>
